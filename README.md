```lrc
[00:26.62] I got a long way to go and a long memory
[00:33.46] I been searching for an answer, always just out of reach
[00:40.10] Blood on the floor, sirens repeat
[00:46.37] I been searching for the courage to face my enemies
[00:52.43] When they turn down the lights
[00:56.76] I hear my battle symphony, all the world in front of me
[01:03.96] If my armor breaks, I'll fuse it back together
[01:10.71] Battle symphony, please, just don't give up on me
[01:16.79] And my eyes are wide awake for my battle symphony
[01:29.23] For my battle symphony
[01:36.12] They say that I don't belong, say that I should retreat
[01:42.77] That I'm marching to the rhythm of a lonesome defeat
[01:49.22] But the sound of your voice puts the pain in reverse
[01:55.43] No surrender, no illusions and for better or worse
[02:01.64] When they turn down the lights
[02:04.73] I hear my battle symphony, all the world in front of me
[02:11.59] If my armor breaks, I'll fuse it back together
[02:18.59] Battle symphony, please, just don't give up on me
[02:24.50] And my eyes are wide awake
[02:30.66] If I fall, get knocked down, pick myself up off the ground
[02:37.16] If I fall, get knocked down, pick myself up off the ground
[02:43.53] When they turn down the lights
[02:48.14] I hear my battle symphony, all the world in front of me
[02:54.64] If my armor breaks, I'll fuse it back together
[03:02.02] Battle symphony, please, just don't give up on me
[03:07.87] And my eyes are wide awake for my battle symphony
[03:20.58] For my battle symphony
